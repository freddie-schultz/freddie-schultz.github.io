What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?

What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?

I don't really know. Some kind of senior developer. I just know that I like programming so I'm assuming that it will be good to pursue as a job.


What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?

My biggest strengths will be my proof-reading skills. My biggest limitations will be my ability to stay focused and motivated.


What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?

While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.
