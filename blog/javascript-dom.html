      <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals and the DOM</h1>
    </div>

        <h3>JavaScript and how it relates to HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          JavaScript provides (almost) all of the functionality of a website. If
          HTML is the building materials and CSS is the paint/wallpaper, then
          JavaScript is the builder putting it all together, and installing all
          of the electrical wiring and plumbing.
        </p>

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Control Flow describes the order in which code is executed within a
          program. It will begin at the start of the program and run everything
          in order until the end, unless it encounters something that will
          change the control flow, e.g. conditionals or loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          A loop is piece of code that will execute over and over again based on
          certain conditions. One example of a loop is a "while loop", which
          will keep executing a block of code while a certain condition holds
          true. Here is a pseudocode while loop which could be included in a
          function for making a bowl of cereal:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>while (bowlOfCereal != hasEnoughMilk){
            pourSomeMoreMilk(bowlOfCereal)
          }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          This would first check that the bowl of cereal doesn't have enough
          milk yet and if so, pour some milk. Then it will check again and if it
          still doesn't have enough milk it will pour some more. It will keep
          doing this until the bowl of cereal does have enough milk. If the bowl
          of cereal already has enough milk on the first check, it won't pour
          any milk.
        </p>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is what pulls together
          the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and turns it into a webpage to display
          on the screen. The DOM consists of a tree of nodes, with each node
          having one parent but potentially many children. The top level node is
          "window" which has the child "document", and from there it branches
          off into the rest of the DOM. The children of "document" include all
          html tags, with any nested tags being the child of the tag they are
          nested inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interacting with the DOM can be done via JavaScript by accessing the
          "document" object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM can also be accessed via developer tools in a web browser,
          e.g. Chrome DevTools
