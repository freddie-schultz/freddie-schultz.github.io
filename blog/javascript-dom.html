      <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals and the DOM</h1>

        <h3>JavaScript and how it relates to HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          JavaScript provides (almost) all of the functionality of a website. If
          HTML is the building materials and CSS is the paint/wallpaper, then
          JavaScript is the builder putting it all together, and installing all
          of the electrical wiring and plumbing.
        </p>

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Control Flow describes the order in which code is executed within a
          program. It will begin at the start of the program and run everything
          in order until the end, unless it encounters something that will
          change the control flow, e.g. conditionals or loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          A loop is piece of code that will execute over and over again based on
          certain conditions. One example of a loop is a "while loop", which
          will keep executing a block of code while a certain condition holds
          true. Here is a pseudocode while loop which could be included in a
          function for making a bowl of cereal:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  while (bowlOfCereal != hasEnoughMilk){
    pourSomeMoreMilk(bowlOfCereal)
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          This would first check that the bowl of cereal doesn't have enough
          milk yet and if so, pour some milk. Then it will check again and if it
          still doesn't have enough milk it will pour some more. It will keep
          doing this until the bowl of cereal does have enough milk. If the bowl
          of cereal already has enough milk on the first check, it won't pour
          any milk.
        </p>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is what pulls together
          the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and turns it into a webpage to display
          on the screen. The DOM consists of a tree of nodes, with each node
          having one parent but potentially many children. The top level node is
          "window" which has the child "document", and from there it branches
          off into the rest of the DOM. The children of "document" include all
          html tags, with any nested tags being the child of the tag they are
          nested inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interacting with the DOM can be done via JavaScript by accessing the
          "document" object. The document object contains a large number of
          properties and methods for interacting with all of the nodes in the
          DOM, including all HTML elements. It can be used to retrieve a node,
          read and modify it's properties and contents, and add event listeners
          to it to allow user interactivity. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  // Retrieve the node with id="myButton" and assign it to a variable called element
  let element = document.querySelector("#myButton")

  // Change the text on the button to say "Press Me!"
  element.textContent = "Press Me!"
       </code></pre>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          The DOM can also be accessed via developer tools in a web browser,
          e.g. Chrome DevTools.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are a list of values that are stored sequentially and can all
          be referenced by their "index", which is a number representing how far
          down the list they are. Array indexes start counting from 0, not 1.
          The index doesn't represent the position in the list, it represents
          how many places you need to jump forward from the first value (index 0
          means jump forward 0 places, leaving you still on the first value).
          The values in an array can be anything, including other arrays or
          objects. Arrays are denoted with square brackets [ ]. Here's an
          example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  // Declaring an array with 4 string values, the letters a, b, c, and d 
  let myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  
  // Accessing a value in the array using its index number
  // This will output the array value with index 2, which is 'c'
  // (counting starts at 0, we jump forward 2 places from the start)
  console.log(myArray[2])
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Objects are similar to arrays, except instead of a sequential list of
          values, they store values with a key/value pair. Every value in an
          object has a key, which is like an ID name. To access a value in an
          array you use the index number, but to access a value in an object you
          use the key. The values in an object can be anything, including other
          objects. Objects are denoted with braces (AKA squiggly brackets) { }.
          To access the values in an object you can use .nameOfKey if you know
          the name of the key, or [nameOfKey] to enter a variable equal to the
          name of the key. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  // Declaring an object for a car with 5 string values, the people sitting in each seat
  let carObject = {
    driver: 'David',
    frontPassenger: 'Sarah',
    rearLeftPassenger: 'Jimmy',
    rearMiddlePassenger: 'Luke',
    rearRightPassenger: 'Colin',
  }

  // Accessing a value in the object using its key
  // This will output the value assigned to the key "frontPassenger"
  console.log(carObject.frontPassenger)

  // Accessing a value in the objbect using a variable to represent the key name
  // This will output the value assigned to the key "driver"
  let carSeat = "driver"
  console.log(carObject[carSeat])
          
                </code></pre>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are a block of code that that will only execute when the
          function is called by name. Functions can be passed one or more
          arguments or can by run by themselves. They can also return a value or
          just run the code alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are useful because they allow a block of code to be run many
          times at different points in the program without having to rewrite all
          the code in the block. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  // Declare a function called greetPerson
  function greetPerson(name, adjective){
    alert('Hello ' + name + '! You are ' + adjective + '!')
  }

  // Call the function for our lovely friend Oliver
  // This will display an alert saying "Hello Oliver! You are lovely!"
  greetPerson('Oliver', "lovely")
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          This function takes 2 arguments and allows us to easily create a
          greeting pop-up for a person, by providing a name and an adjective to
          describe that person. We can call this function as many times as we
          want with different names and adjectives and don't have to keep
          re-writing the alert() message.
        </p>
