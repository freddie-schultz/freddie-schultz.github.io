        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is a general term to describe our understanding
          of our own emotions and how they affect ourselves and others. It
          includes the ability for us to recognize what emotions we are feeling
          without being directly affected by them, understanding the emotions of
          others, and using this information to guide our mental and physical
          habits and intentions.
        </p>
        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
          EQ is different to IQ in that it does not focus on our abililty to
          solve abstract or knowledge-based problems, but instead focuses on our
          ability to understand how we solve problems and how we can improve our
          ability to learn new information. IQ is about what you know and EQ is
          about how you learn it.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>
          EQ is important because it improves our ability to communicate and
          work in teams. It improves our ability to learn and retain new
          information.
