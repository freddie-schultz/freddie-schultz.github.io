        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          When I was younger I found a $10 note on the floor at the dairy. I
          could have taken it without anyone else knowing and become $10 richer,
          or I could have tried getting it back to the rightful owner. I decided
          to hand it in to the cashier and tell them where I found it, in case
          the owner came back looking for it. I think this was the right
          decision and I feel good about it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I grew up in a loving family and try to treat everyone with fairness
          and respect.

        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          Some strengths I have are spelling/grammar and attention to detail. I
          believe this will help me with identifying errors in code. More
          abstractly, another strength I have is creativity which will help with
          problem solving.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I think some limitations I have is a lack of long term goals and
          planning, and lack of patience. This could lead to low motivation
          which will negatively affect my learning journey.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          While studying at WINTEC, I was working on a group presentation and
          there was resistance and tension because different group members
          wanted to present the project in different ways. I did not attempt any
          strategies at the time, and project did not go smoothly. A strategy I
          would try now would be to start a conversation about the differences
          in opinions and try to work out some compromises to make everyone
          happy.

        <h3>DOPE (4 Personality Types)</h3>
        <p>My score on the DOPE test is: <strong>Owl 50%</strong></p>
        <p>
          The description is: Logical, mathematically minded, methodical and
          sometimes seen as a perfectionist. They can be slow to make decisions
          and inflexible if rules and logic says otherwise. They are not big
          risk takers but love detail.
        </p>

        Here's how I scored on the other types:<br />
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          <li>Eagle (20%)</li>
