        <h2>When I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
        <p>
          During Sprint 4 we were doing JavaScript challenges called Kata. One
          of the challenges was called "Gradebook" and it required us to add and
          modify properties inside of a data object that represented a
          gradebook. This object contained records of the students, and each
          student had a record of all of their scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the tasks involved creating a function to add a new score to a
          student's list of scores. This function would be given the student's
          name and the score to add. While I was writing this function, I used
          the wrong syntax for accessing the student properties in the gradebook
          object. JavaScript objects have 2 ways of accessing their properties:
          dot notation (Object.property) and bracket notation
          (Object[property]). The difference between these is that dot notation
          uses the exact name of the property you are accessing, and bracket
          notation uses a variable that is equal to the name of the property you
          are accessing. When I first wrote the function for this challenge I
          used dot notation to access a student's record but I was using a
          variable that represented the student's name:
        </p>
        <p>I used:</p>
        <pre><code>
  gradebook.studentName.testScores
        </code></pre>
        <p>instead of:</p>
        <pre><code>
  gradebook[studentName].testScores
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This meant that I was trying to access a record with the student name
          "studentName" instead of a record with the student name that equalled
          the value of the studentName variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To problem solve this I looked at the error message given by the
          built-in tests: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
          (reading 'testScores'). This let me know there was something wrong
          with gradebook.studentName, as it was coming back as undefined. I
          looked at the code again and remembered that if I wanted to access the
          gradebook property that equalled the value of the studentName
          variable, I needed to use bracket notation and not dot notation. I
          changed my function to use
          <code style="font-size: 12pt">gradebook[studentName].testScores</code>
          and then it started working correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving this problem reinforced my knowledge of bracket notation and
          dot notation and when to use each.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">How I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Another one of our JavaScript Kata challenges was called "Builtin
          Methods" and involved using built-in JavaScript methods to achieve a
          result, instead of creating our own methods that do the same thing.
          One of the problems required us to write a function that will take a
          sentence as a string, and return a new string that is the same
          sentence but with every word capitalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first started solving this problem, I wrote out pseudocode to
          get a general idea of what needed to be done and in what order. My
          pseudocode went like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Create another function called capitalizeFirstLetter, to take a
            string and return that string but capitalized
          </li>
          <li>
            Split the string into an array of words, with a space as the
            separator
          </li>
          <li>
            Map each word into a new array. Each word is capitalized by
            supplying the capitalizeFirstLetter function into map()
          </li>
          <li>
            Iterate through the new array and add each word into a new string,
            adding a space after every word except the last
          </li>
          <li>Return that new string</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This pseudocode technically works fine, and so did my initial answer:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalizeFirstLetter(s) {
    let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
    firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
    return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
  }

  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map(capitalizeFirstLetter)
    let newSentence = ''

    for (let i in capitalizedWords) {
      newSentence += capitalizedWords[i]
      if (i &lt; capitalizedWords.length - 1) {
        newSentence += ' '
      }
    }

    return newSentence
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          However, there are a few improvements I can make to this code to
          prevent unnecessary functions and make it more concise. Firstly, the
          final step of adding all the elements of the capitalizedWords array,
          with spaces after every word except the last, can be completely
          replaced with the Array.join() function. This takes every element of
          an array and joins them together into one string, with the supplied
          argument added in between every word. Here's what my answer looked
          like next:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalizeFirstLetter(s) {
    let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
    firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
    return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
  }

  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map(capitalizeFirstLetter)
    return capitalizedWords.join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The next improvement I can make is to remove the extra
          capitalizeFirstLetter() function and include it inside the
          capitalize() function:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map((s) => {
      let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
      firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
      return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
    })
    return capitalizedWords.join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Now my answer was down to a single function, but I'm not done yet!
          Both the capitalize function and the function inside the map method
          can be reduced down to a single line. Instead of declaring a variable,
          working on that variable, then returning the variable, I can just
          return the working step. Here it is with the map function reduced to
          one line:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map((s) => {
      return s.substr(0, 1).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1, s.length)
    })
    return capitalizedWords.join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          And the final step is to also reduce the capitalize function to one
          line, leaving this elegant (in my eyes) solution:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalize(string) {
    return string.split(' ').map((s) => {
      return s.substr(0, 1).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1, s.length)
    }).join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The problem solving techniques I used were pseudocode and trying
          something. The initial pseudocode was important for understanding the
          logic and flow of what needed to happen in my function(s), then I
          slowly replaced and consolidated sections while trying it out at every
          step to make sure I was still getting the correct results.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process reinforced my knowledge of the .map() and .join() methods
          and also helped me further understand using arrow notation (=>) for
          functions. It opened my eyes to how much a function (or functions) can
          be consolidated.

          My Confidence With Using Problem Solving Techniques
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am feeling quite confident with the various problem solving
          techniques in programming:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pseudocode: This was useful during the kata challenges, as well as
            other challenges we have completed. I feel comfortable using it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying something: A classic, and something I have been doing since I
            first started programming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rubber ducky method: This was a new one to me, and I have used it
            multiple times during this course (most of the time successfully)
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading error messages: This is a great technique, they are the true
            truth! I don't always understand the error messages, but that's
            where the next technique comes in
          </li>
          <li>
            Googling! Another classic, used in all aspects of like, not just
            programming. Googling is excellent for understanding error messages
            and learning new methods and the syntax to use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Console.logging: This is another technique I have been using for a
            long time. If anything doesn't work the way I expect, I console.log
            the variable or object I'm working with to make sure it is what I
            think it is, then work from there. This works great with "typeof ".
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking your peers and coaches for help: This is another new one for
            me. I have asked a few questions in discord and always get multiple
            responses and answers, so I'm feeling confident with this one.
            (Thank you everyone!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving your process with reflection: This is probably my least
            confident technique, although I have seen the benefits of it. I've
            been reflecting in my Learnal (Learning Journal) with new methods
            and syntax that I have learned, but I think I could be reflecting
            more things and more often.
