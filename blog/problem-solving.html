        <h2>When I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
        <p>
          During Sprint 4 we were doing JavaScript challenges called Kata. One
          of the challenges was called "Gradebook" and it required us to add and
          modify properties inside of a data object that represented a
          gradebook. This object contained records of the students, and each
          student had a record of all of their scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the tasks involved creating a function to add a new score to a
          student's list of scores. This function would be given the student's
          name and the score to add. While I was writing this function, I used
          the wrong syntax for accessing the student properties in the gradebook
          object. JavaScript objects have 2 ways of accessing their properties:
          dot notation (Object.property) and bracket notation
          (Object[property]). The difference between these is that dot notation
          uses the exact name of the property you are accessing, and bracket
          notation uses a variable that is equal to the name of the property you
          are accessing. When I first wrote the function for this challenge I
          used dot notation to access a student's record but I was using a
          variable that represented the student's name:
        </p>
        <p>I used:</p>
        <p>gradebook.studentName.testScores</p>
        <p>instead of:</p>
        <p>gradebook[studentName].testScores</p>
        <p>
          This meant that I was trying to access a record with the student name
          "studentName" instead of a record with the student name that equalled
          the value of the studentName variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To problem solve this I looked at the error message given by the
          built-in tests: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
          (reading 'testScores'). This let me know there was something wrong
          with gradebook.studentName, as it was coming back as undefined. I
          looked at the code again and remembered that if I wanted to access the
          gradebook property that equalled the value of the studentName
          variable, I needed to use bracket notation and not dot notation. I
          changed my function to use gradebook[studentName].testScores and then
          it started working correctly.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          Solving this problem reinforced my knowledge of bracket notation and
          dot notation and when to use each.
        </p>
        <h2>How I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Another one of our JavaScript Kata challenges was called "Builtin
          Methods" and involved using built-in JavaScript methods to achieve a
          result, instead of creating our own methods that do the same thing.
          One of the problems required us to write a function that will take a
          sentence as a string, and return a new string that is the same
          sentence but with every word capitalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first started solving this problem, I wrote out pseudocode to
          get a general idea of what needed to be done and in what order. My
          pseudocode went like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Create another function called capitalizeFirstLetter, to take a
            string and return that string but capitalized
          </li>
          <li>
            Split the string into an array of words, with ' ' as the separator
            (.split(' '))
          </li>
          <li>
            Map each word into a new array. Each word is capitalized by
            supplying the capitalizeFirstLetter function into map()
          </li>
          <li>
            Iterate through the new array and add each word into a new string,
            adding a space after every word except the last
          </li>
          <li>Return that new string</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This pseudocode technically works fine, and so did my initial answer:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalizeFirstLetter(s) {
    let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
    firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
    return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
  }

  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map(capitalizeFirstLetter)
    let newSentence = ''

    for (let i in capitalizedWords) {
      newSentence += capitalizedWords[i]
      if (i &lt; capitalizedWords.length - 1) {
        newSentence += ' '
      }
    }

    return newSentence
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          However, there are a few improvements I can make to this code to
          prevent unnecessary functions and make it more concise. Firstly, the
          final step of adding all the elements of the capitalizedWords array,
          with spaces after every word except the last, can be completely
          replaced with the Array.join() function. This takes every element of
          an array and joins them together into one string, with the supplied
          argument added in between every word. Here's what my answer looked
          like next:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalizeFirstLetter(s) {
    let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
    firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
    return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
  }

  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map(capitalizeFirstLetter)
    return capitalizedWords.join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The next improvement I can make is to remove the extra
          capitalizeFirstLetter() function and include it inside the
          capitalize() function:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  function capitalize(string) {
    let wordsInString = string.split(' ')
    let capitalizedWords = wordsInString.map((s) => {
      let firstLetter = s.substr(0, 1)
      firstLetter = firstLetter.toUpperCase()
      return firstLetter + s.slice(1, s.length)
    })
    return capitalizedWords.join(' ')
  }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Now my answer was down to a single function, but I'm not done yet!
          Both the capitalize function and the function inside the map method
          can be
        </p>
