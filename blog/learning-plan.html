        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          To be some kind of senior developer. I know that I like programming
          and would like to pursue it as a career.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths will be my maths and proof-reading skills. My
          biggest limitations will be my ability to stay focused and motivated.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h3>
        <p>Working in groups and staying focused for 9 weeks.</p>
        <h3>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>Taking on a growth mindset.</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>To answer questions and provide support when needed.</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          To keep an open mind and not give up when it gets hard. Embrace the
          "Not yet" mentality.
        </p>
        <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I want to be a senior developer of some kind.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          My strengths include being logical, mathematically minded, and a bit
          of a perfectionist. Some of my limitations are a lack of patience when
          things aren't going as I expect or when I don't understand something.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          Patience, perserverance, and self-regard.
        </p>
        <h3>
          My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme:
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will commit to being in my office by 8:45am each morning and I won't
          have any "distraction tabs" open while actively working/studying.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          When things build up and start to get to me, I will take a break from
          my desk and go for a walk.
        </p>
        <h3>
          My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way:
        </h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I will seek help from the Facilitators and my cohort via discord
          channels or direct messages.
        </p>
        <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation Team:</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I expect the Facilitation Team to be available for questions during
          study hours and to provide advice/guidance when needed.
        </p>
        <h3>My important scheduling information:</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">
          I do not have any important scheduling conflicts. The only other
          important regular activity I have is going to the gym which I plan to
          do after 5:15pm each day.
