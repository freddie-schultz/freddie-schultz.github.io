        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people
        </h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
          because being aware of how it works will encourage you to take steps
          to improve yourself. Knowing that it is possible to change the way
          your brain works is empowering and motivating.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity by going to the
          gym every day. The repetition is strengthening my neural connections.
        </p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Learn and practice new skills/information. By learning skills or
          information and then repeating them, we can rewire our brains to adapt
          to them.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is the belief that you have the ability to change and
          grow your mind, and the desire to take on new challenges and learn new
          information. It is relevant because it will be a great advantage to
          have a growth mindset during this course, especially because this
          course covers a lot of information in a short amount of time.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          Hopefully my mindset is what will change for me. I believe I have been
          in a fixed mindset for most (if not all) of my life. It's a bit
          disheartening to think about it, and think about where I could be if I
          had taken on a growth mindset earlier in life, but I know I can't
          change the past so I'm working on changing my attitude and outlook for
          the future.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Keep reminding myself that it exists and keep pushing myself to do the
          routine things that are good for me (eat well, sleep well, exercise)
        </p>

        <h3>
          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
          your learning plan and strategy
        </h3>
        <p>
          I hope to influence my learning by adopting a growth mindset and
          reminding myself about neuroplasticity. It's a matter of practice and
          repetition so I need to keep doing it every day.
