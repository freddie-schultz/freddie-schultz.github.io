Neuroplasticity

Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.

Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because being aware of how it works will encourage you to take steps to improve yourself. Knowing that it is possible to change the way your brain works is empowering and motivating.


Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.

I am engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity by going to the gym every day. The repetition is strengthening my neural connections.


What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?

Learn and practice new skills/information. By learning skills or information and then repeating them, we can rewire our brains to adapt to them.

Growth Mindset

Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.

Growth Mindset is the belief that you have the ability to change and grow your mind, and the desire to take on new challenges and learn new information. It is relevant because it will be a great advantage to have a growth mindset during this course, especially because this course covers a lot of information in a short amount of time.


In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

Hopefully my mindset is what will change for me. I believe I have been in a fixed mindset for most (if not all) of my life. It's a bit disheartening to think about it, and think about where I could be if I had taken on a growth mindset earlier in life, but I know I can't change the past so I'm working on changing my attitude and outlook for the future.


How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

Keep reminding myself that it exists and keep pushing myself to do the routine things that are good for me (eat well, sleep well, exercise)
