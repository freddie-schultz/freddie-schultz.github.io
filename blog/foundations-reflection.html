        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The details of neuroplasticity and growth mindset, and how they
            apply to me. I have lived most of my life in a fixed mindset and
            need to switch to a growth mindset.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned about the difference between EQ and IQ and why/how
            they are both important in real-world working scenarios.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have learned about Te Whare Tapa Whā, and how I can use each of
            the foundations to guide my habits in a healthy and productive way.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values and empathy are important for understanding, respecting, and
          communicating with others. Self-awareness is important for learning
          because learning is a self-directed activity. You need to understand
          yourself to understand how to learn.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          How much it is valued in the job industry and how much it can affect
          someone's learning and development.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Writing about myself and doing the listening and looping tasks. I
          don't like writing about myself, I find it difficult and
          uncomfortable. The listening and looping exercises were hard because 2
          minutes of content was a lot to remember. I found I was able to recall
          the first half accurately but then forgot what the last parts were.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because human skills are needed to find a job and work successfully as
          a developer.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, I don't think so. I think the human skills are important
          real-world skills.
