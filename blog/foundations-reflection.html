          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The details of neuroplasticity and growth mindset, and how they
            apply to me.
          </li>
          <li>I can't think of anything else to write</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Values and empathy are important for understanding, respecting, and
          communicating with others. Self-awareness is important for learning
          because learning is a self-directed activity. You need to understand
          yourself to understand how to learn.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>How difficult it is to write about</p>
        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>
        <p>Writing these blog posts</p>
        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because human skills are needed to find a job and work successfully as
          a developer
        </p>
        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, I don't think so. I think the human skills are important
          real-world skills.
