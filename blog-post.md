Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

Nothing comes to mind immediately, not sure if I understand exactly what an ethical decision is.
I always clean up after myself in shared environments. It is a sign of respect and something I pride myself in.


Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

I grew up in a loving family and try to treat everyone with fairness and respect.


Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

Some strengths I have are spelling/grammar and attention to detail. I believe this will help me with identifying errors in code.
More abstractly, another strength I have is creativity which will help with problem solving and design.


Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

I think some limitations I have is a lack of long term goals and planning, and lack of patience. This could lead to low motivation which will negatively affect my learning journey.


Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

Working with a colleague to roll out new desktops, I felt resistance because I didn't think they were performing up to my standards. This caused tension because I do not like conflict and did not address it with them. My strategy was to do more of the work myself (a "If you want it done right, do it yourself" type of attitude). The short term effectiveness was honestly not bad, because the work got done and to a high enough standard, however it was more of a bandaid solution and didn't address the underlying problem and didn't give the colleague an opportunity to learn. Upon reflection, I should have addressed the issue with the colleague and shared how I was doing things with them. I don't think they were intentionally performing worse than me, they just didn't know how/what to do. This would have increased their knowledge and reduced my stress.
